# Python Tutorial - || Hunt Down Social Media Accounts by Usernames for Open-Source Intelligence || Looking-Glass v1.0

This tool is a Python OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence Tool) for finding information on people that you do not know, but have only a social media/site username of the target.

Then once you get a hit for that username on other social media sites/sites, you can then look for more information through their posts, data, pictures, etc that may give away more info on their IRL location, name, etc. As people tend to use the same username for every site/social media site they use.

Also, it is likely that people slip up somewhere and you can find data on where they are IRL just by having the data to go through, this tool is a way to get that data.
